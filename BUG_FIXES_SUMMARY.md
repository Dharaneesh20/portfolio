# üêõ Bug Fixes Summary - October 25, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Coding Progress Save Error - FIXED

**Problem:** Coding progress was failing to save from admin panel due to undefined/empty values being sent.

**Solution:** Added data cleaning before sending to API.

**Changes in `client/src/pages/Admin.tsx`:**
```javascript
// Clean up the data - remove undefined/empty values
const cleanData = {
  platform: formData.platform,
  username: formData.username,
  profileUrl: formData.profileUrl,
  totalProblems: parseInt(formData.totalProblems) || 0,
  ...(formData.rank && { rank: formData.rank }),
  ...(formData.rating && { rating: parseInt(formData.rating) }),
  ...(formData.currentStreak && { currentStreak: parseInt(formData.currentStreak) }),
  ...(formData.stats && {
    stats: {
      easy: parseInt(formData.stats.easy) || 0,
      medium: parseInt(formData.stats.medium) || 0,
      hard: parseInt(formData.stats.hard) || 0
    }
  })
}
```

**How It Works:**
- Parses numbers properly (totalProblems, rating, etc.)
- Only includes optional fields if they have values
- Ensures stats object is properly formatted
- Prevents undefined values from being sent

**Test It:**
1. Go to `/admin`
2. Click "Coding Progress"
3. Click "Add Platform Progress"
4. Fill in required fields (platform, username, URL, total problems)
5. Optionally add rank, rating, streak
6. Optionally add Easy/Medium/Hard stats
7. Click "Create"
8. Should save successfully! ‚úÖ

npm install jspdf
```

**Added in `client/src/pages/CV.tsx`:**

**UI Changes:**

- PDF button has FaFilePdf icon
- Text button has FaDownload icon
- Both buttons have hover effects

**Test It:**
1. Go to `/cv` page
2. Click "Download PDF" button
3. PDF should download with professional formatting ‚úÖ
4. Click "Download Text" button
5. Text file should also download ‚úÖ

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Logo Display Issue - TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem:** Company and institution logos not showing in CV section

**Current Status:** Code is correct, logos should display if logoUrl is provided.

**What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ Logo URL input fields in admin
- ‚úÖ Logo saving to database
- ‚úÖ Logo rendering code in CV.tsx
- ‚úÖ Model schema includes logoUrl

**Potential Causes:**
1. **Logo URL not saved yet** - Add URL first in admin
2. **Invalid/broken URL** - URL must be accessible
3. **Missing http:// or https://** - Full URL required
4. **CORS issue** - Some sites block image loading

**How to Fix:**

**Step 1: Add Logo URL in Admin**
1. Go to `/admin`
2. Click "CV" card
3. Scroll to "Work Experience" section
4. Find the experience entry
5. Look for "Company Logo URL (optional)" field
6. Add a valid URL, for example:
   - `https://logo.clearbit.com/microsoft.com`
   - `https://logo.clearbit.com/google.com`
   - Or any direct image URL
7. Click "Save CV"

**Step 2: Test on CV Page**
1. Go to `/cv` page
2. Logos should appear next to company/institution names
3. Size: 64x64 pixels (w-16 h-16)
4. Rounded corners with border

**Logo URL Examples:**
```
Microsoft: https://logo.clearbit.com/microsoft.com
Google: https://logo.clearbit.com/google.com
Amazon: https://logo.clearbit.com/amazon.com
IBM: https://logo.clearbit.com/ibm.com
```

**Code Reference (already correct):**
```tsx
{(exp.logoUrl || exp.logo) && (
  <img
    src={exp.logoUrl || exp.logo}
    alt={exp.company}
    className="w-16 h-16 object-contain rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 p-2"
  />
)}
```

**If Still Not Working:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for errors
3. Verify URL is accessible (paste in browser)
4. Try different image URL
5. Check network tab for failed requests
